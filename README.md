# Why is Hax MultiTool Not Open-Source????
in the past, while the project was not popular at all, i've already had to deal with skids. there was this guy in my school who tried claiming the file as thiers. so i obfuscated the code, but Hax is no virus. <br>**When the project will reach enough audience, the program's code will be published.**
